# External dependencies

No paper-specific external theorem exemption is used for the six numbered results, four-query construction, or retained introduction consequences. All operational assertions concern the actual finite fixed circuit model, arbitrary complete ancillary/control Hilbert spaces and actual executed query norms. The literature’s previous unrestricted upper bound 3 is background comparison and is not reconstructed or claimed as a formalized theorem. That background omission does not waive any required own result.

The shared official Comparator is pinned by the monorepo tooling. Its allowed axioms are recorded separately in each fixed configuration. Challenge statements and intentionally invalid negative controls are verification fixtures and are excluded from the production entry.
