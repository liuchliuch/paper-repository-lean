# External dependencies

No paper-specific external theorem exemption is used. All retained mathematical and metered construction results are proved over pinned Mathlib with only the standard permitted axioms. The runtime theorem counts the explicitly defined integer/word comparisons, list operations and route copying; it does not assert a compiler-level wall-clock bound. Intermediate integer magnitudes and capacities have separate proved polynomial bounds.

## Pinned software

The shared official Comparator is pinned by the monorepo tooling. Its allowed axioms are recorded separately in each fixed configuration. Challenge statements and intentionally invalid negative controls are verification fixtures and are excluded from the production entry.
